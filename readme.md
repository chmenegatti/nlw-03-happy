| [server.ts](https://github.com/chmenegatti/nlw-03-happy.git/blob/main/server/src/server.ts)                | This code snippet sets up an Express server with features such as CORS, error handling, image upload, and database connection. It listens on port 3333 and serves the API routes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [routes.ts](https://github.com/chmenegatti/nlw-03-happy.git/blob/main/server/src/routes.ts)                | This code snippet creates routes for an API using Express.js. It includes functionality for retrieving a list of orphanages, retrieving a specific orphanage by ID, and creating a new orphanage with image uploads.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [routes.tsx](https://github.com/chmenegatti/nlw-03-happy.git/blob/main/web/src/routes.tsx)                 | This code snippet defines the routes for a React application using React Router. It sets up routes for a landing page, an orphanages map page, a create orphanage page, and an orphanage details page. The routes are defined using the BrowserRouter and Switch components from react-router-dom.                                                                                                                     |
| [react-app-env.d.ts](https://github.com/chmenegatti/nlw-03-happy.git/blob/main/web/src/react-app-env.d.ts) | The provided code snippet includes a reference to react-scripts, indicating that it is a React application. Unfortunately, without access to the actual code, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive summary of its core functionalities.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [index.tsx](https://github.com/chmenegatti/nlw-03-happy.git/blob/main/web/src/index.tsx)                   | The code snippet uses React and ReactDOM libraries to render the App component into the element with the id'root'. It ensures strict mode for debugging purposes. The App component is responsible for rendering the user interface of the application.                                                                                                                                                                |
| [App.tsx](https://github.com/chmenegatti/nlw-03-happy.git/blob/main/web/src/App.tsx)                       | This code snippet is a React component that serves as the entry point for the application. It imports the necessary dependencies, including the'Routes' component, and applies global styles. The'App' component renders a div with the class name "App" and includes the'Routes' component within it. Essentially, this code sets up the overall structure of the application and establishes the main routing logic. |
